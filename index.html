              A website has the power to make or break a business. A site that is appealing and easy to use will reel in new customers and boost profits. If it takes forever to load or looks dated, that company will lose sales to their competition - and their brand image could suffer lasting damage.
              Needless to say, the art of web development has become incredibly important. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, developer jobs are projected to increase by 13% over the next 8 years, exceeding the average growth rate of most other jobs.
              If you are hoping to enter a stable industry with skills that literally every organization needs, then you’re starting in the right place. This is our complete guide to computer programming: we’ll explore what it means to become a developer, and delve into the most common terms and definitions.

              The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
              Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

              Python is a general-purpose programming language. 
              If you see any survey on popular programming languages over the last few years, Python 
              always comes on top of the demand chart each year.People who hate programming are tempted to change
              their minds by the simplicity of Python. Most of the job listings have Python somewhere as part of 
              the job description. Let us see what makes Python so special in this decade and future. Candidates 
              and companies upskill or reskill in Python irrespective of their qualifications, roles, and experience. Needless to say, 
              Python is very easy to learn.

                HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of 
                any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are 
                initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed 
                from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, 
                scripts, and more.

                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you
                to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page 
                does more than just sit there and display static information for you to 
                look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
                scrolling video jukeboxes.</div>
